| :- |
|<p>To get started with Python, you will need to download and install the Python software. You can download the latest version of Python from the official [Python website ](https://www.python.org/downloads)([https://www.python.org /downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads)). Once you have installed Python, you can start writing and running code.</p><p>To write code in Python, you can use any text editor or integrated development environment (IDE). Some popular IDEs for Python include IDLE (the built-in Python IDE), PyCharm, and Visual Studio Code.</p><p>**Python Libraries**</p>|
|Python has a wide range of libraries available that provide additional functionality for different tasks. Some of the most popular libraries include:|
|**Library**|**Description**|
|**NumPy**|A library for working with arrays and matrices.|
|**Pandas**|A library for working with data frames and data analysis.|
|**Matplotlib**|A library for creating visualizations and plots.|
|**Scikit-learn**|A library for machine learning and data mining.|
|**Python Functions**|
|Python functions are blocks of code that can be reused multiple times. A function is defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name and a set of parentheses. The code inside the function is executed when the function is called.![](Aspose.Words.64614aa1-c6cb-46d1-9cc9-480d3a56c289.005.png)|


|For example, the following code defines a function called greet that prints a message:|
| - |
|<p>def greet(name):</p><p>`    `print(f"Hello, {name}")</p><p>greet("John")</p>|
|<p>When the code is run, it will print "Hello, John".</p><p>**Built-in Functions**</p><p>Python has a variety of built-in functions that can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, such as:</p>|
|**Function**|**Description**|
|print()![](Aspose.Words.64614aa1-c6cb-46d1-9cc9-480d3a56c289.006.png)|The *print* function is used to display output to the console.|
|len()![](Aspose.Words.64614aa1-c6cb-46d1-9cc9-480d3a56c289.007.png)|The *len* function is used to find the length of a string or a list.|
|str()![](Aspose.Words.64614aa1-c6cb-46d1-9cc9-480d3a56c289.008.png)|The *str* function is used to convert a value to a string.|
|int()![](Aspose.Words.64614aa1-c6cb-46d1-9cc9-480d3a56c289.009.png)|The *int* function is used to convert a value to an integer.|
|min()![](Aspose.Words.64614aa1-c6cb-46d1-9cc9-480d3a56c289.010.png)|The *min* function is used to find the minimum value in a list or a string.|
|max()![](Aspose.Words.64614aa1-c6cb-46d1-9cc9-480d3a56c289.011.png)|The *max* function is used to find the maximum value in a list or a string.|
